This driver lets use a Graphical User Interface as BrlTTY device:
it behaves just like a real braille device, its cost excepted :)

It is mostly intended for sighted developers who don't have access to a real
device, but still want to have an idea of the result.
It is most useful for writing BrlAPI applications.

Assuming you're under X, first launch brltty:
$ brltty -b xw

(note: to be able to run brltty as non-root user, give the
--without-screen-driver option to ./configure before compiling)

Then you can launch a BrlAPI application:
$ ~/brltty/Programs/apitest

You may give several parameters to the driver:
$ brltty -b xw -t identity -B tkparms="-geometry -0+0",lines=2,cols=20,model=bare
will set a 20x2 braille display appear in the upper right corner of the
display, without any navigation key. There is also the vs model which will show
up most of VisioBraille device's keys.

If you want braille display as well, you'll need the ClearlyU font
(included in recent xfonts-base packages) and a UTF-8 locale for
characters: if your usual locale is en_US, launch brltty with a
prepended LC_CTYPE:

LC_CTYPE=en_US.UTF-8 brltty ...
