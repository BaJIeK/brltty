<H2><A NAME="s3">3. Using BRLTTY</A></H2>

<P>Before starting BRLTTY, you need to set up your braille display.
In most cases this is done simply
by connecting it to an available serial port,
and then turning it on.
After your display has been set up,
run BRLTTY simply by typing the command <CODE>brltty</CODE> at a shell prompt
(this must be done as root).
Check the
<A HREF="#options-braille-device">-d</A> command line option,
the 
<A HREF="#configure-braille-device">braille-device</A> configuration file directive,
and the 
<A HREF="Manual-2.html#make-braille-device">BRLDEV</A> make file variable
for alternatives regarding how to tell BRLTTY which device your display is connected to.
Check the
<A HREF="#options-braille-driver">-b</A> command line option,
the 
<A HREF="#configure-braille-driver">braille-driver</A> configuration file directive,
and the 
<A HREF="Manual-2.html#make-braille-driver">BRL_TARGET</A> make file variable
for alternatives regarding how to tell BRLTTY which kind of braille display you have.
Check the
<A HREF="#options-braille-parameters">-B</A> command line option,
and the 
<A HREF="#configure-braille-parameters">braille-parameters</A> configuration file directive
for alternatives regarding how to pass parameters to the driver for your braille display.
<P>A message giving the program name (BRLTTY) and its version number
will appear briefly
(see the 
<A HREF="#options-message-delay">-M</A> command line option)
on the braille display.
The display will then show a small area of the screen including the cursor.
By default, the cursor is represented as
dots 7 and 8 superimposed on the character it is on.
<P>Any screen activity will be reflected on the braille display.
The display will also follow the progress of the cursor on the screen.  
This feature is known as <B>cursor tracking</B>.
<P>Just typing on the keyboard and reading the display, however, isn't enough.
Try entering a command which will cause an error, and pressing <B>enter</B>.  
The error appears on the screen, but, unless you have a multi-line display,
the chances are that it isn't visible on the braille display.
All you see thereon is another shell prompt.
What's needed, then, is some way to move
the braille <EM>window</EM> around the screen.
The keys on the braille display itself can be used to send commands to BRLTTY
which, in addition to a lot of other things, can also do exactly that.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="ss3.1">3.1 Commands</A>
</H2>

<P>Unfortunately, the various braille displays don't offer a standard set of controls.
Some have the six standard dot keys, some have eight, and others have none.
Some have thumb keys, but there's no standard number of them.
Some have a button above each braille cell.
Some have rocker switches.
Some have an easy-to-reach bar which works much like a joystick.
Most have varying combinations of the above.
Because the nature and layout of each display is so different,
please refer to the documentation for your particular display
in order to find out exactly what its keys do.
<P>BRLTTY commands are referred to by name within this manual.
If you forget which key(s) on your braille display to use
for a paticular command, then refer to its driver's help page.
The main key you should immediately commit to memory, therefore, is the one
for the 
<A HREF="#command-HELP">HELP</A> command.
Use the regular motion keys (as described below) to navigate the help page,
and press the <CODE>help</CODE> key again to quit.

<DT><B>FWINLT
<A NAME="command-FWINLT"></A> </B><DD><P>Go left one window.
This command is particularly useful when reading backward
because it automatically wraps up to the end of the previous line
when invoked at the beginning of the current line.
Other features like its ability to skip blank windows
(see the 
<A HREF="#command-SKPBLNKWINS">SKPBLNKWINS</A> command)
further enhance its usefulness for this purpose.
<DT><B>FWINRT
<A NAME="command-FWINRT"></A> </B><DD><P>Go right one window.
This command is particularly useful when reading forward
because it automatically wraps down to the beginning of the next line

<P>
<H3>Feature Activation</H3>

<P>Each of these commands has three forms:
<B>activate</B> (turn the feature on),
<B>deactivate</B> (turn the feature off),
and <B>toggle</B> (if it's off then turn it on, and if it's on then turn it off).
Unless specifically noted, each of these features
is initially <B>off</B>, and, when <B>on</B>, affects BRLTTY's operation as a whole.
The initial setting of some of these features can be changed
via the 
<A HREF="#preferences-menu">preferences menu</A>.
<DL>
<DT><B>FREEZE
<A NAME="command-FREEZE"></A> </B><DD><P>Freeze the screen image.
BRLTTY makes a copy of the screen (content and attributes)
as of the moment when the screen image is frozen,
and then ignores all updating of the screen until it's unfrozen.
This feature makes it easy, for example,
to sample the output of an application which writes too much too quickly.
<DT><B>DISPMD
<A NAME="command-DISPMD"></A> </B><DD><P>Show the highlighting (the attributes)
of each character within the braille window,
rather than the characters themselves (the content).
This feature is useful, for example,
when you need to locate a highlighted item.
When showing screen content, the text translation table is used
(see the 
<A HREF="#options-text-table">-t</A> command line option,
the 
<A HREF="#configure-text-table">text-table</A> configuration file directive,
and the 
<A HREF="Manual-2.html#make-tables-text">TEXTTRANS</A> make file variable).
When showing screen attributes, the attributes translation table is used
(see the 
<A HREF="#options-attributes-table">-a</A> command line option,
the 
<A HREF="#configure-attributes-table">attributes-table</A> configuration file directive,
and the 
<A HREF="Manual-2.html#make-tables-attributes">ATTRTRANS</A> make file variable).
This feature only affects the current virtual terminal.
<DT><B>SIXDOTS
<A NAME="command-SIXDOTS"></A> </B><DD><P>Show characters using 6-dot, rather than 8-dot, braille.
Dots 7 and 8 are still used by other features
like cursor representation and highlighted character underlining.
If a contraction table has been selected
(see the 
<A HREF="#options-contraction-table">-c</A> command line option
and the 
<A HREF="#configure-contraction-table">contraction-table</A> configuration file directive),
then it is used.
This setting can also be changed with the
<A HREF="#preference-text-style">Text Style</A> preference.
<DT><B>SLIDEWIN
<A NAME="command-SLIDEWIN"></A> </B><DD><P>If cursor tracking
(see the 
<A HREF="#command-CSRTRK">CSRTRK</A> command)
is <B>on</B>, then,
whenever the cursor moves too close to (or beyond)
either end of the braille window,
horizontally reposition the window such that the cursor,
while remaining on that side, is nearer the centre.
If this feature is <B>off</B>,
then the braille window is always positioned such that
its left end is a multiple of its width from the left edge of the screen.
This setting can also be changed with the
<A HREF="#preference-sliding-window">Sliding Window</A> preference.
<DT><B>SKPIDLNS
<A NAME="command-SKPIDLNS"></A> </B><DD><P>Rather than explicitly moving exactly one line either up or down,
skip passed lines which have the same content as the current line.
This feature affects the 
<A HREF="#command-LNUP">LNUP</A>
and 
<A HREF="#command-LNDN">LNDN</A> commands,
as well as the line wrapping feature of
the 
<A HREF="#command-FWINLT">FWINLT</A>,
<A HREF="#command-FWINRT">FWINRT</A>,
<A HREF="#command-FWINLTSKIP">FWINLTSKIP</A>,
and 
<A HREF="#command-FWINRTSKIP">FWINRTSKIP</A> commands.
This setting can also be changed with the
<A HREF="#preference-skip-identical-lines">Skip Identical Lines</A> preference.
<DT><B>SKPBLNKWINS
<A NAME="command-SKPBLNKWINS"></A> </B><DD><P>Skip passed blank windows when reading either forward or backward.
This feature affects the 
<A HREF="#command-FWINLT">FWINLT</A>
and 
<A HREF="#command-FWINRT">FWINRT</A> commands.
This setting can also be changed with the
<A HREF="#preference-skip-blank-windows">Skip Blank Windows</A> preference.
<DT><B>CSRVIS
<A NAME="command-CSRVIS"></A> </B><DD><P>Show the cursor by superimposing a dot pattern
(see the 
<A HREF="#command-CSRSIZE">CSRSIZE</A> command)
on top of the character where it is.
This feature is initially <B>on</B>.
This setting can also be changed with the
<A HREF="#preference-show-cursor">Show Cursor</A> preference.
<DT><B>CSRHIDE
<A NAME="command-CSRHIDE"></A> </B><DD><P>Hide the cursor (see the 
<A HREF="#command-CSRVIS">CSRVIS</A> command)
in order to accurately read the character beneath it.
This feature only affects the current virtual terminal.
<DT><B>CSRTRK
<A NAME="command-CSRTRK"></A> </B><DD><P>Track (follow) the cursor.
If the cursor moves to a location which isn't within the braille window,
then automatically move the braille window to the cursor's new location.
You'll usually want this feature turned on
since it minimizes the effects of screen scrolling,
and since, during input, the region wherein you're currently typing is always visible.
If this feature causes the braille window to jump at an inopportune moment,
then use the 
<A HREF="#command-BACK">BACK</A> command
to get back to where you were reading.
You may need to turn this feature off when using an application which
continually updates the screen while maintaining a fixed data layout.
This feature is initially <B>on</B>.
This feature only affects the current virtual terminal.
<DT><B>CSRSIZE
<A NAME="command-CSRSIZE"></A> </B><DD><P>Represent the cursor with all eight dots (a solid block),
rather than with just dots 7 and 8 (an underline).
This setting can also be changed with the
<A HREF="#preference-cursor-style">Cursor Style</A> preference.
<DT><B>CSRBLINK
<A NAME="command-CSRBLINK"></A> </B><DD><P>Blink (turn on and off according to a predefined interval)

This setting can also be changed with the
<A HREF="#preference-blinking-cursor">Blinking Cursor</A> preference.
<DT><B>ATTRVIS
<A NAME="command-ATTRVIS"></A> </B><DD><P>Underline (with combinations of dots 7 and 8) highlighted characters.
<DL>
<DT><B>no underline</B><DD><P>White on black (normal),

This feature is initially <B>on</B>.
This setting can also be changed with the
<A HREF="#preference-blinking-attributes">Blinking Attributes</A> preference.
<DT><B>CAPBLINK
<A NAME="command-CAPBLINK"></A> </B><DD><P>Blink (turn on and off according to a predefined interval)
capital (uppercase) letters.
This setting can also be changed with the
<A HREF="#preference-blinking-capitals">Blinking Capitals</A> preference.
<DT><B>TUNES
<A NAME="command-TUNES"></A> </B><DD><P>Play a short predefined tune (see 
<A HREF="#tunes">Alert Tunes</A>)
whenever a significant event occurs.

<A NAME="command-SETLEFT"></A> </B><DD><P>Horizontally reposition the braille window so that
its left edge is at the column associated with the routing key.
This feature makes it very easy to put the window exactly where it's needed,
and, therefore, for displays which have routing keys,
almost eliminates the need for a lot of elementary window motion
(like the 
<A HREF="#command-CHRLT">CHRLT</A>,

<H2><A NAME="routing"></A> <A NAME="ss3.2">3.2 Cursor Routing</A>
</H2>

<P>When moving the braille window around the screen
while examining the text, say, in an editor,
you often need to bring the cursor
to a specific character within the braille window.
You'll probably find this to be a rather difficult task for a number of reasons.
One is that you may not know where the cursor is,
and that you may lose your place while trying to find it.
Another is that the cursor may move unrpedictably as the arrow keys are pressed
(some editors, for example, don't allow the cursor to be
more to the right than the end of the line it's on).
Cursor routing provides just such a capability
by knowing where the cursor is,
by simulating the same arrow-key presses which you'd have to enter manually,
and by monitoring the progress of the cursor as it moves.
<P>Some braille displays have a button, known as a routing key, above each cell.
These keys use the 
<A HREF="#command-ROUTE">ROUTE</A> command
to route the cursor right to the desired location.
<P>Cursor routing, while very convenient and effective,
is, strictly speaking, not completely reliable.
One reason for this is that its current implementation assumes
VT100 cursor key escape sequences.
Another is that some applications do non-standard things
in response to detecting that a cursor key has been pressed.
A minor problem found within some editors (like <CODE>vi</CODE>),
as already mentioned above,
is that they throw in some unpredictable horizontal motion
when vertical motion is requested
because they don't allow the cursor to be to the right of the end of a line.
A major problem found within some web browsers (like <CODE>lynx</CODE>)
is that the up- and down-arrow keys are used to move among the links
(which may skip lines and/or move the cursor horizontally,
but which rarely just moves the cursor one line in the desired direction),
and that the left- and right-arrow keys are used to select links
(which has absolutely nothing to do with any form of cursor motion whatsoever,
and which even totally changes the screen content).
<P>Cursor routing may not work very well on a heavily loaded system,
and definitely doesn't work very well when working on a remote system over a slow link.
This is so because of all of the checks which must be made along the way
in order to deal with unpredictable cursor motion
and in order to ensure that any mistake has at least a fighting chance to be undone.
Even  though BRLTTY tries to be fairly clever,
it must still essentially wait to see what happens after each simulated arrow-key press.
<P>Once a cursor routing request has been made,
BRLTTY keeps trying to route the cursor to the desired location until
a timeout expires before the cursor reaches that location,
the cursor seems to be moving in the wrong direction,
or you switch to a different virtual terminal.
An attempt is first made to use virtical motion
to bring the cursor to the right line,
and, only if that succeeds, an attempt is then made
to use horizontal motion to bring the cursor to the right column.
If another request is made while one is still in progress,
then the first one is aborted and the second one is initiated.
<P>A safer but less powerful cursor routing command,
<A HREF="#command-CSRJMP_VERT">CSRJMP_VERT</A>,
uses just vertical motion to bring the cursor
to anywhere on the top line of the braille window.
It's especially useful in conjunction with applications (like <CODE>lynx</CODE>)
wherein horizontal cursor motion must never be attempted.
<P>
<H2><A NAME="cut"></A> <A NAME="ss3.3">3.3 Cut and Paste</A>
</H2>

<P>This feature enables you to grab some text which is already on the screen 
and re-enter it at the current cursor position.
Using it saves time and avoids errors
when a long and/or complicated piece of text needs to be copied,
and even when the same short and simple piece of text needs to be copied many times.
It's particularly useful for things like
long file names,
complicated command lines,
E-mail addresses,
and URLs. Cutting and pasting text involves three simple steps:
<OL>
<LI>Mark either the top-left corner of the rectangular area
or the beginning of the linear area
on the screen which is to be grabbed (cut).
If your display has routing keys,
then move the braille window so that
the first character to be cut appears anywhere within it, and then:
<UL>
<LI>invoke the 
<A HREF="#command-CUTBEGIN">CUTBEGIN</A> command
to start a new cut buffer</LI>
<LI>invoke the 
<A HREF="#command-CUTAPPEND">CUTAPPEND</A> command
to append to the existing cut buffer</LI>
</UL>

by pressing the key(s) associated with it
and then pressing the routing key associated with the character.</LI>
<LI>Mark either the bottom-right corner of the rectangular area
or the end of the linear area
on the screen which is to be grabbed (cut).
If your display has routing keys,
then move the braille window so that
the last character to be cut appears anywhere within it, and then
<UL>
<LI>invoke the 
<A HREF="#command-CUTRECT">CUTRECT</A> command
to cut a rectangular area</LI>
<LI>invoke the 
<A HREF="#command-CUTLINE">CUTLINE</A> command
to cut a linear area</LI>
</UL>

by pressing the key(s) associated with it
and then pressing the routing key associated with the character.
Marking the end of the cut area
appends the selected screen content to the cut buffer.
Excess white-space is removed from the end of each line in the cut buffer
so that unwanted trailing spaces won't be pasted back in.
Control characters are replaced with blanks.</LI>
<LI>Insert (paste) the text where it's needed.
Place the cursor over the character where the text is to be pasted,
and invoke the 
<A HREF="#command-PASTE">PASTE</A> command.
You can paste the same text any number of times without recutting it.
This description assumes that you're already in some sort of input mode.
If you paste when you're in some other kind of mode
(like <CODE>vi</CODE>'s command mode),
then you'd better be aware of what the characters in the cut buffer will do.</LI>
</OL>
<P>The cut buffer is also used by
the 
<A HREF="#command-PRSEARCH">PRSEARCH</A>
and 
<A HREF="#command-NXSEARCH">NXSEARCH</A> commands.

<H2><A NAME="status"></A> <A NAME="ss3.5">3.5 The Status Display</A>

<P>The status display is a summary of BRLTTY's current state
which fits completely within the braille window.
Some braille displays have a set of status cells
which are used to permanently display some of this information as well
(see the documentation for your display's driver).
The data presented by this display isn't static, and may change at any time
in response to screen updates and/or BRLTTY commands.
<P>Use the

to switch to the status display,
and use it again to return to the screen.
The layout of the information contained therein
is dependent on the size of the braille window.

It can be accessed
either by the

or via the 
<A HREF="Manual-2.html#utility-brltest">brltest</A> utility.
<P>When this mode is entered,
the message <CODE>command learn mode</CODE> is written to the braille display.
Then, as each key (or key combination) on the display is pressed,
a short message describing its BRLTTY function is written.
This mode exits immediately if the key (or key combination)
for the 
<A HREF="#command-LEARN">LEARN</A> command is pressed.
It exits automatically, and the message <CODE>done</CODE> is written,
if ten seconds elapse without any key on the display being pressed.
Note that some displays don't signal the driver
and/or some drivers don't signal BRLTTY
until all the keys are released.
<P>If a message is longer than the braille display is wide,
then it's displayed in segments.
The length of each segment but the last is one less than the display's width,
with the rightmost character on the display being set to a minus sign.
