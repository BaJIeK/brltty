This directory contains the BRLTTY speech driver for the ViaVoice
[http://www.ibm.com/software/speech/dev/ttssdk_linux.html] text to speech
system from International Business Machines (IBM) [http://www.ibm.com]. It has
been implemented, and is being maintained, by Dave Mielke <dave@mielke.cc>.

This driver can be dynamically loaded (at run time), but cannot be statically
linked into BRLTTY (at make time), because it relies on a shared object
(libibmeci50.so) within ViaVoice's run time kit. BRLTTY's main make file
automatically builds this driver if, and only if, ViaVoice's software
development kit has been installed (it checks for the existence of
/usr/include/eci.h).

The path to the ini file is determined via the following huristic. If the
driver parameter "inifile" is set, then that value is used. If it isn't, but if
the environment variable "ECIINI" is set, then that value is used. If neither
is set, then the default (/usr/lib/ViaVoiceTTS/eci.ini) is used.

This driver recognizes the following additional parameters (see the file
tts.pdf in the ViaVoice documentation directory for details):
