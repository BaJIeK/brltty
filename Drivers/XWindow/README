This driver lets use an X window as BrlTTY device: it behaves just like a
real braille device, its cost excepted :)

It is mostly intended for sighted developers who don't have access to a real
device, but still want to have an idea of the result.

For now, it is most useful for writing BrlAPI applications.
First launch brltty as root, but with X access:
# export DISPLAY=:0.0
# brltty -b xw -t identity

Then you can launch a BrlAPI application:
$ export CONTROLVT=7                 # if X is running on VT 7
$ ~/brltty/Programs/apitest
