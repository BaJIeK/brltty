This directory contains the BRLTTY driver for braille displays which are
manufactured by Handy Tech Elektronik GmbH [http://www.handytech.com/] of
Germany. As a component of BRLTTY, this driver is released under the terms of
the GNU Public License. It has been tested with the modular displays
[20/40/80], the Braille Wave, the Braille Star [40/80], the Bookworm, and
the Braillino.

This driver was originally implemented by Andreas Gross <andi@andi-bika.de>. It
has since been extended, and is being maintained, by Dave Mielke
<dave@mielke.cc>. Thanks to Mike Pedersen <mpedersen@mindspring.com> for his
help with the design and testing of the Braille Star component. Thanks to Jill
Clark <jill@handytech.com> of Handy Tech Elektronik for having graciously lent
us a Bookworm so that its component could be tested. Thanks to Mario Lang 
<mlang@delysid.org> for his help with the development of USB and bluetooth 
support.

A HandyTech display can be used via its serial, USB, or bluetooth interface. If
you're using a serial connection then specify "serial:/path/to/device", e.g. 
"serial:/dev/ttyS0". If you're using a USB connection then specify "usb:" (the
trailing colon is important). If you're using a bluetooth connection then
specify "bluez:address", e.g. "bluez:01:23:45:67:89:AB".
