This directory contains the BRLTTY driver for braille displays which are
manufactured by Handy Tech Elektronik GmbH [http://www.handytech.com/] of
Germany. As a component of BRLTTY, this driver is released under the terms of
the GNU Public License. It has been tested with the modular displays
[20/40/80], the Braille Wave, the Braille Star [40/80], the Bookworm, and
the Braillino.

This driver was originally implemented by Andreas Gross <andi@andi-bika.de>. It
has since been extended, and is being maintained, by Dave Mielke
<dave@mielke.cc>. Thanks to Mike Pedersen <mpedersen@mindspring.com> for his
help with the design and testing of the Braille Star component. Thanks to Jill
Clark <jill@handytech.com> of Handy Tech Elektronik for having graciously lent
us a Bookworm so that its component could be tested.
