Possible improvements:
-Get comments and possibly rework key bindings.
-Add some more bindings: for toggling some environment settings
   for instance.
-Find a way to somehow make the installation and insertion of the module
   more seemless.
-Investigate the possibility of starting BRLTTY from the "hotplug" system.
-Turn the display off when idle to save power on laptops.
