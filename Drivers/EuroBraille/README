SUPPORTED HARDWARE
==================
All EuroBraille's displays should be supported here. However it has been tested
on the following hardware:
   - a Clio-Notebraille display (20 and 40 cells);
   - a Scriba display (40 cells only at this time);
   - Someone reported that it worked pretty well with an Azerbraille display;
   - The driver is although tested with a NoteBraille display in order to 
     maintain backward compatibility.


FIXES/ADDITIONS
===============
Version 1.0 :
   - added an internal menu to allow console switching or to enter in the help 
     Here, a Scriba-like interface was implemented. Read the "README.menu"
     file if you didn't use a Scriba (or the Draculawin program) before to
     learn more about this menu.
   - When the drivers starts, it now plays a melody on the terminal's internal 
     speaker. This was made to ensure the user that the driver is loaded and is
     ready to be used.

Version 0.9: 
   - You can now view the internal date/time of your display, typing "#M" (or
     "Alpha+L9" on a Scriba). This doesn't work very well - don't know why...

Version 0.8:
   - Minor changes were made in the use of the "inskey()" function.
   - Fixed bugs in the ViewOn() and the Program() functions.

Version 0.7: 
   - Added the "Programming" and the "View on" functions. Their respective 
     behaviors are as in the DOS program (ReadBraille). See the "README.model"
     file where "Model" is the name of your display. Actually, files are 
     written for the Clio-Notebraille and the Scriba displays.

Version 0.6:
   - Fixed the "enter bug": The "\n" inserted code is now replaced by "\x0D".

Version 0.5: 
   - Added the ability for the user to type letters directly from his/her
     terminal. The table implemented is the CBIFS (French) table.

Comments are strongly welcomed, because I don't know how many people use the 
EuroBraille version of BRLTTY in the world so if you use this driver, just 
e-mail me what are your suggestions for next versions.
