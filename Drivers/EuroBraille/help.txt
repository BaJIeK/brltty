BRLTTY help screen for EuroBraille terminals 

Please note that this file is no longer used by BrlTty. The Learn Mode is umeh
more interractive and better to use. 
To entre in the Learn-Mode, click on the "I Z" cell to enter in the internal
menu and then click the "Help" item.
If you don't know how the menu system works, (if you never used Scriba or 
DraculaWin), an explaination of the work can be found in the README.menu file,
located in the EuroBraille directory of your brltty copy.

Please note that the README file contains although version information and
copyright notice, so if you find a bug that was not listed out in the README
file, feel free to send an e-mail to me (plassi_y@epitech.net), because it's
hard to test all possible functions, even if I use the driver 10 hours a day. 
Thank you.
