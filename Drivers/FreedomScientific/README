This directory contains the BRLTTY driver for the Focus and PacMate braille
displays from Freedom Scientific [http://www.freedomscientific.com]. It has
been implemented, and is being maintained, by Dave Mielke <dave@mielke.cc>.

The serial and USB ports are both supported. The following models are 
recognized:
*  Focus: 44, 70, 84
*  PacMate: 20, 40

If an unrecognized model is connected then the driver makes an attempt to
determine its size and to provide generic capabilities.
