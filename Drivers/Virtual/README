Virtual Display Driver
----------------------

This is a virtual braille display driver for BRLTTY.  It uses a simple
text-based protocol over a socket to transmit information to, and to receive
information from, the virtual braille display application. The intention of
this driver is two-fold:
 * Give interested developers the ability to test BRLTTY without requiring 
   access to a real braille display.
 * Enable the implementation of a visual display based on this driver which
   allows a sighted person to see, and even to experience, how a blind person
   uses a braille display to work with a computer.

This driver supports the following parameters:
mode={client | server}
   This parameter determines which end of the socket connection is owned by the 
   driver. If it's "client" then the driver periodically tries to connect to 
   the braille display application. If it's "server" then the driver waits for 
   a connection request from the braille display application. The default mode
   is "client".
socket=<address>
   This parameter specifies the network address of the braille display 
   application. The default address is a TCP/IP connection on the default port 
   on the local host. The address may be:
   /path/to/unix-socket-file
      If the address starts with a slash (/) then it's interpreted as the path
      to a unix socket file. If the driver is in "client" mode then the 
      specified file must already exist. If the driver is in "server" mode then 
      the specified file is created by the driver and must not already exist.
   [host][:[port]]
      An IP address. The TCP/IP protocol is used. Both the host and port 
      components of the address are optional. The delimiting colon (:) is only 
      required if the port is being specified. The host may be a name, an 
      alias, or an IPV4 address (in dotted-decimal form); if it's not supplied 
      then the local host is assumed. The port may be a service name or a port 
      number; if it's not supplied then 35752 is assumed.
