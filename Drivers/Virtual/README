Virtual display driver
----------------------

This is a Virtual Display driver for BRLTTY.  It opened a listening
TCP port and uses a special text based protocol to transmit the information to
the remote end.

The intention of this backend is two-fold:
 * Give interested developers the ability to test BRLTTY without
   the availability of a real Braille display.
 * Eventually provide a visual client based on this backend which
   allows to demonstrate to people with normal sight how
   a blind person works with the computer using a braille display.

However, there is currently no visual client for this protocol
written.  You can use telnet or netcat to use it in the meantime.

Implementation Notes:
---------------------

Currently, all invasive commands, like cursor routing, or keyboard
input are intentionally not implemented.  This is because the vr
driver actually presents a security risk.  Since it is very hard to
come up with an actually secure scheme for remote authentification,
I decided to just not implement the very dangerous functionality
for now.  This does not mean that you should use the vr driver
without caution.  It can still be used to sniff information
off your console.
