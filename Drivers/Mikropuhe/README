This directory contains the BRLTTY speech driver for the Mikropuhe text to
speech engine [http://www.mikropuhe.com] from TimeHouse
[http://www.timehouse.fi/oy/en/]. It was implemented, and is being maintained,
by Dave Mielke <dave@mielke.cc>.

BRLTTY's configure script automatically includes this driver if Mikropuhe has
been installed. The default is to check the directories /usr, /usr/local, and
/opt/theta. The actual location can be explicitly specified via --with-mplinux.

This driver can be either dynamically loaded (at run time) or built directly
into a dynamically linked BRLTTY binary (via --with-speech-driver), but it
cannot be built into a statically linked BRLTTY binary (via
--enable-standalone-programs) because the Mikropuhe package doesn't contain a
static archive. 

If this driver is built as a dynamically loaded shared object (the default),
i.e. it isn't linked into BRLTTY's binary via --with-speech-driver, then the
directory $THETA_HOME/lib must be added to the colon-delimited list of
directories in the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable before BRLTTY is
started because Theta's own shared objects don't contain run-time search paths
for their internal dependencies.

This driver recognizes the following parameters:

   Parameter Settings
   name      name (human), /path/to/directory
   pitch     -2.0-2.0 (octaves relative to default)

If the human name of the voice is specified then the voice path is searched. 
This path can be explicitly defined by storing a colon-delimited list of
directories in the THETA_VOXPATH environment variable. The default is to look
in $THETA_HOME/voices.
