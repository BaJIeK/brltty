The english manual in plain text format is in Manual.txt.
It's also available in html: start at Manual-HTML/Manual.html.
It's sgml source is in Manual.sgml.

A german translation is also available:
plain text in Manual-ger.txt,
html starting at Manual-ger-HTML/Manual.html,
and sgml source in Manual-ger.sgml.
This translation is, at this point, quite a bit out-of-date.
