<P>BRLTTY gives a braille user access to the text consoles of a Linux system.
It runs as a background process (daemon)
which operates a refreshable braille display,
and can be started very early in the system boot sequence.
It enables a braille user, therefore, to easily independently handle
aspects of system administration such as
single user mode entry,
file system recovery,
and boot problem analysis.
It even greatly eases such routine tasks as logging in.
<P>BRLTTY reproduces a rectangular portion of the screen
(referred to within this document as `the window')
as braille text on the display.
Controls on the display can be used to
move the window around on the screen,
to enable and disable various viewing options,
and to perform special functions.

<H2><A NAME="ss1.1">1.1 A Brief History</A>
</H2>

<P>The BRLTTY project started in July, 1995.
The initial team consisted of Nikhil Nair and James Bowden.
The first version ran with Blazie Engineering's Braille Lite.
Since, at that time, the Braille Lite hadn't been designed to be
a dedicated refreshable braille display for a computer,
its response time was far too slow.
This situation has now been corrected.
<P>The second version, BRLTTY 0.22 BETA, was released in September of 1995.
It was the first to be released publicly.
As well as the Braille Lite, it also supported
Tieman B.V.'s CombiBraille series.
<P>James Bowden stopped being an active developer,
although his continued help in other areas (including documentation)
was much appreciated.
Two new members, Nicolas Pitre and Stéphane Doyon, joined the team.
They added support for Alva and Telesensory Systems Inc. displays,
as well as many excellent features for the system as a whole.
A stable version (1.0) was released sometime around the end of 1996.
<P>Support for Papenmeier displays has been contributed by a team from
The Technical High School, Department of Electrical Engineering, Vienna, Austria.
Support for the TSI displays was completed,
and support for the EuroBraille brand was added.
New features were also continually being added to the system.
Regretably, Nikhil Nair stopped working on the BRLTTY project.
Nicolas Pitre assumed the job of maintainer.
<P>Version 2.0 was released during the summer of 1998,
and version 2.1 was released in March of 1999.
It added support for
EcoBraille (thanks to Oscar Fernandez),
Alva Delphi (thanks to Terry Barnaby),
and Braille Lite 18 (from Nikhil Nair),
as well as Some small improvements and fixes.
<P>Dave Mielke began to submit fixes and enhancements during 2000,
and joined the team as the next maintainer in June of 2001.
Thanks to Nicolas Pitre for his many years of service in this capacity.
<P>BRLTTY now supports many braille displays
(see section 
<A HREF="Manual-7.html#displays">Supported Braille Displays</A> for the full list),
as well as some speech synthesizers
(see section 
<A HREF="Manual-7.html#synthesizers">Supported Speech Synthesizers</A> for the full list).
See section 
<A HREF="Manual-8.html#contact">Contact Information</A> for details regarding how to contact the BRLTTY team.

<H2><A NAME="ss1.2">1.2 System Requirements</A>
</H2>

<P>To date, BRLTTY only runs under Linux.
While ports to other Unix-like operating systems aren't currently planned,
we do welcome any interest in such projects.
<P>This software has been tested on a variety of Linux systems:
<UL>
<LI>Desktops, laptops, and some PDAs.</LI>
<LI>Processors from a 386SX20 to a Pentium.</LI>
<LI>A huge range of memory sizes.</LI>
<LI>Several distributions including Debian, Red Hat, Slackware, and SuSE.</LI>
<LI>Many kernels, including 1.2.13, 2.0, 2.2, and 2.4.</LI>
<LI>A DEC Alpha
(only tested once under Red Hat Alpha Linux on a noname board kindly lent
to the Cambridge University Computer Laboratory by DEC in Reading, England).</LI>
</UL>
<P>BRLTTY's main dependence on Linux is a special device (<CODE>vcsa</CODE>)
via which the screen contents and attributes can be read.
An experimental patch for the <CODE>screen</CODE> program is provided
(see the <CODE>Patches</CODE> subdirectory).
It allows BRLTTY to access <CODE>screen</CODE>'s screen image via shared memory,
and goes a long way toward making porting to other platforms possible
(even to those which don't have their own screen content inspection facility).
The main weakness of the <CODE>screen</CODE> approach is that 
BRLTTY can't be started until the user has logged in.
<P>BRLTTY, as noted above, relies on a special device
which provides easy access to the contents of the current virtual console.  
This device was introduced in version 1.1.92 of the Linux kernel,
and is normally called either <CODE>/dev/vcsa</CODE> or <CODE>/dev/vcsa0</CODE>
(on systems with <CODE>devfs</CODE> it's called <CODE>/dev/vcc/a</CODE>).
For this reason, Linux kernel 1.1.92 or later is required.
<P>In order for BRLTTY to successfully communicate with the refreshable braille display,
the correct Linux driver (serial, parallel, USB) must be configured into the kernel.
If the driver requires special options, then they must be supplied.
If it's built into the kernel, then its options must be
set during the kernel configuration procedure,
supplied at the LILO boot prompt,
or specified on an <CODE>append</CODE> directive in <CODE>/etc/lilo.conf</CODE>.
If it's a module, then its options must be
supplied as options to the <CODE>modprobe</CODE> (or <CODE>insmod</CODE>) command,
or specified on an <CODE>options</CODE> directive in <CODE>/etc/modules.conf</CODE>
(called <CODE>/etc/conf.modules</CODE> by some older distributions).
<P>BRLTTY only works with text-based consoles and applications.
It can be used with <CODE>curses</CODE>-based applications,
but not with any application which
either uses special VGA features
or requires a graphics console (like the X Window system).
<P>You must also, of course, possess a supported refreshable braille display
(see section 
<A HREF="Manual-7.html#displays">Supported Braille Displays</A> for the complete list).
We hope that additional displays will be supported in the future, so,
if you have any vaguely technical programming information
for a device which you'd like to see supported,
then please let us know (see section 
<A HREF="Manual-8.html#contact">Contact Information</A>).
<P>Finally, you need tools to build the executable from its source:
<CODE>make</CODE>, <CODE>C</CODE> and <CODE>C++</CODE> compiler, <CODE>yacc</CODE>, <CODE>awk</CODE>, etc.
The development tools provided with standard Linux distributions should suffice.
BRLTTY has been tested on many distributions,
including Slackware, Debian, and Red Hat.
If you have problems,
then contact us and we'll compile a binary for you.
