It's a good idea, though,
to first become familiar with the files which will ultimately be installed.</P>

<P>Here's what to do if you just want to install BRLTTY as quickly as possible,
trusting that all of our defaults are correct.
<OL>
<LI>Download the source.
It'll be a file named
<CODE>brltty-</CODE><EM>release</EM><CODE>.tar.gz</CODE>,
e.g. <CODE>brltty-3.0.tar.gz</CODE>.</LI>
<LI>Unpack the source into its native hierarchical structure.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
tar xzf brltty-<EM>release</EM>.tar.gz
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

This should create the directory <CODE>brltty-</CODE><EM>release</EM>.</LI>
<LI>Change to the source directory, configure, compile, and install BRLTTY.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
cd brltty-<EM>release</EM><BR>
./configure<BR>
make install
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

This should be done as <B>root</B>.</LI>
</OL>
</P>
<P>To uninstall BRLTTY, do:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
cd brltty-<EM>release</EM><BR>
make uninstall
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</P>
<P>That's all there's to it.
Now, for those who really want to know what's going on, here are the details.</P>

<H3><A NAME="build"></A> Build Options</H3>

<P>The first step in building BRLTTY is to configure it
for your system and/or for your personal needs.
This is done by running the <CODE>configure</CODE> script in BRLTTY's top-level directory.
We've tried to make the defaults fit the most common case, so,
assuming that you're not attempting to do anything out of the ordinary,
you may not need to do anything more complicated than
invoke this script without specifying any options at all.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
./configure
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

If, however, you have some special requirements,
or even if you're just adventurous,
you should find out what your choices are.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
./configure --help
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

You should also check out the <CODE>README</CODE> file in the subdirectory
containing the driver for your braille display
for any additional display-specific instructions.</P>

For <EM>driver</EM>, specify the two-letter
<A HREF="Manual-8.html#drivers">driver identification code</A>
corresponding to your braille display.
For <EM>device</EM>, specify the full path
for the device to which your braille display is connected.</P>
<P>If you don't want to explicitly identify the driver and device
each time you start BRLTTY, then you can take two approaches.
You can establish system defaults
via the 
<A HREF="Manual-3.html#configure-braille-driver">braille-driver</A>
and the 
<A HREF="Manual-3.html#configure-braille-device">braille-device</A>
configuration file directives,
and/or compile your needs right into BRLTTY
via the 
<A HREF="#build-braille-driver">--with-braille-driver</A>
and the 
<A HREF="#build-braille-device">--with-braille-device</A>
build options.</P>
<P>If all is well, BRLTTY's version identification message
should appear on the braille display for a few seconds
(see the 
<A HREF="Manual-3.html#options-message-delay">-M</A> command line option).
After it goes away (which you can hasten by pressing any key on the display),
the area of the screen where the cursor is should appear.
This means that you should expect to see your shell's command prompt.
Then, as you enter your next command,
each character should appear on the display as it's typed on the keyboard.</P>
<P>If this is your experience, then leave BRLTTY running, and enjoy it.
If this isn't your experience, then it may be necessary
to test each driver separately in order to isolate the source of the probledm.
The screen driver can be tested with 
<A HREF="#utility-scrtest">scrtest</A>,
and the braille display driver can be tested with 
<A HREF="#utility-brltest">brltest</A>.</P>
<P>If you experience a problem which requires a lot of digging,
then you may wish to use the following <CODE>brltty</CODE> command line options:
<UL>
<LI>
<A HREF="Manual-3.html#options-log-level">-ldebug</A>
to log lots of diagnostic messages.</LI>
<LI>
<A HREF="Manual-3.html#options-no-daemon">-n</A>
to keep BRLTTY in the foreground.</LI>
<LI>
<A HREF="Manual-3.html#options-standard-error">-e</A>
to direct diagnostic messages to standard error
rather than to the system log.</LI>
</UL>

<H2><A NAME="ss2.4">2.4</A> <A HREF="Manual.html#toc2.4">Starting BRLTTY</A>
</H2>

<P>BRLTTY, when properly installed, is invoked with the single command <CODE>brltty</CODE>.
A configuration file
(see section 
<A HREF="Manual-3.html#configure">The Configuration File</A> for details)
can be created in order to establish system defaults for such things as
the location of the preferences file,
the braille display driver to be used,
the device to which the braille display is connected,
and the text translation table to be used.
Many options
(see section 
<A HREF="Manual-3.html#options">Command Line Options</A> for details)
allow explicit run-time specification of such things as
the location of the configuration file,
any defaults established within the configuration file,
and some characteristics which have reasonable defaults
but which those who think they know what they're doing may wish to play with.
The 
<A HREF="Manual-3.html#options-help">-h</A> option
displays a summary of all the options.
The 
<A HREF="Manual-3.html#options-version">-v</A> option
displays the current version of the program and the selected drivers.</P>
<P>It's probably best to have the system automatically start BRLTTY
as part of the boot sequence
so that the braille display is already up and running when the login prompt appears.
Most (probably all) distributions provide a script wherein
user-supplied applications can be safely started near the end of the boot sequence.
The name of this script is distribution-dependent.
Here are the ones we know about so far:
<DL>
<DT><B>Red Hat</B><DD><P><CODE>/etc/rc.d/rc.local</CODE></P>
</DL>
</P>
<P>Starting BRLTTY from this script is a good approach (especially for new users).
Just add a set of lines like these:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
if [ -x /bin/brltty ]
then
   /bin/brltty
fi
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

This can usually be abbreviated to the somewhat less readable form:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
[ -x /bin/brltty ] &amp;&amp; /bin/brltty
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Don't add these lines before the first line
(which usually looks like <CODE>#!/bin/sh</CODE>).</P>
<P>If the braille display is to be used by a system administrator,
then it should probably be started as early as possible during the boot sequence
(like before the file systems are checked)
so that the display is usable
in the event that something goes wrong during these checks
and the system drops into single user mode.
Again, exactly where it's best to do this is distribution-dependent.
Here are the places we know about so far:
<DL>
<DT><B>Debian</B><DD><P><CODE>/etc/init.d/boot</CODE> for older releases,
and <CODE>/etc/init.d/rcS</CODE> for newer releases.</P>
<DT><B>RedHat</B><DD><P><CODE>/etc/rc.d/rc.sysinit</CODE>
Beware that later releases,
in order to support a more user-oriented system initialization procedure,
have this script reinvoke itself such that
it's under the control of <CODE>initlog</CODE>.
Look, probably right up near the top, for a set of lines like these:
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
<PRE>
    # Rerun ourselves through initlog
    if [ -z "$IN_INITLOG" ]; then
      [ -f /sbin/initlog ] &amp;&amp; exec /sbin/initlog $INITLOG_ARGS -r /etc/rc.sysinit
    fi
    
</PRE>
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

Starting BRLTTY before this reinvocation
results in two BRLTTY processes running at the same time,
and that'll give you no end of problems.
If your version of this script has this feature,
then make sure you start BRLTTY after the lines which implement it.</P>
<DT><B>Slackware</B><DD><P><CODE>/etc/rc.d/rc.S</CODE></P>
<DT><B>SuSE</B><DD><P><CODE>/sbin/init.d/boot</CODE></P>
</DL>
</P>
<P>An alternative is to start BRLTTY from <CODE>/etc/inittab</CODE>.
You have two choices if you choose this route.
<UL>
<LI>If you want it to be started really early
but don't need it to be automatially restarted if it dies,
then add a line like this before the first <CODE>:sysinit:</CODE> line which is already in there.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
brl::sysinit:/bin/brltty
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
</LI>
<LI>If you don't mind it being started later
but do want it to be automatially restarted if it dies,
then add a line like this anywhere within the file.
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
brl:12345:respawn:/bin/brltty -n
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>

The 
<A HREF="Manual-3.html#options-no-daemon">-n</A> (<CODE>--nodaemon</CODE>) option is very
important when running BRLTTY with <B>init</B>'s <CODE>respawn</CODE> facility.
You'll end up with hundreds of BRLTTY processes all running at the same time
if you forget to specify it.</LI>
</UL>

Check that the identifier (<CODE>bt</CODE> in these examples)
isn't already being used by another entry,
and, if it is, choose a different one which isn't.</P>
<P>Note that a command like <CODE>kill -TERM</CODE>
is sufficient to stop BRLTTY in its tracks.
If it dies during entry into single user mode, for example,
it may well be due to a problem of this nature.</P>
<P>Some systems experience problems if an application tries to use
the kernel's sound subsystem before it has been initialized.
If your system is one of them, then
you may need to disable the automatic starting of the speech synthesizer driver
with the 
<A HREF="Manual-3.html#options-no-speech">-N</A> option.</P>
<P>Some systems, as part of the boot sequence, probe the serial ports
(usually in order to automatically find the mouse and deduce its type).
If your braille display is using a serial port,
this kind of probing may be enough to get it confused.
If this happens to you, then try restarting the braille driver
(see the 
<A HREF="Manual-3.html#command-RESTARTBRL">RESTARTBRL</A> command).
Better yet, turn off the serial port probing.
Here's what we know so far about how to do this:
<DL>
<DT><B>Red Hat</B><DD><P>The probing is done by a service named <CODE>kudzu</CODE>.
Use the command 
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
chkconfig --list kudzu
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
 to see if it's been enabled.
Use the command 
<BLOCKQUOTE><CODE>
chkconfig kudzu off
</CODE></BLOCKQUOTE>
 to disable it.
Later releases allow you to let <CODE>kudzu</CODE> run
without probing the serial ports.
To do this, edit the file <CODE>/etc/sysconfig/kudzu</CODE>,
and set <CODE>SAFE</CODE> to <CODE>yes</CODE>.</P>
</DL>
</P>
<P>If you want to start BRLTTY before any file systems are mounted, then
ensure that all of its components are installed within the root file system.
See the 
<A HREF="#build-execute-root">--with-execute-root</A>,
<A HREF="#build-program-directory">--bindir</A>,
<A HREF="#build-data-directory">--sysconfdir</A>,

<A HREF="#build-library-directory">--libdir</A>
build options.</P>

<H2><A NAME="ss2.5">2.5</A> <A HREF="Manual.html#toc2.5">Security Considerations</A>
</H2>

<P>BRLTTY needs to run with root privileges because it needs
read and write access for the port to which the braille display is connected,
read access to <CODE>/dev/vcsa</CODE> or equivalent
(to query the screen dimensions and the cursor position,
and to review the current screen content and highlighting),
and read and write access to the system console
(for arrow key entry during cursor routing,
for input character insertion during paste,
for special key simulation using keys on the braille display,
for retrieving output character translation and screen font mapping tables,
and for activation of the internal beeper).
Access to the needed devices can, of course, be granted to a non-root user
by changing the file permissions associated with the devices.
Merely having access to the console, however, isn't enough because
activating the internal beeper and simulating key strokes still require root privilege.
So, if you're willing to give up cursor routing, cut&amp;paste, beeps,
and all that, you can run BRLTTY without root priviledge.</P>
