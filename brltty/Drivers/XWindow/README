This driver lets use an X window as BrlTTY device: it behaves just like a
real braille device, its cost excepted :)

It is mostly intended for sighted developers who don't have access to a real
device, but still want to have an idea of the result.
It is most useful for writing BrlAPI applications.

Assuming you're under X, first launch brltty:
$ brltty -b xw

(note: to be able to run brltty as non-root user, give the
--without-screen-driver option to ./configure before compiling)

Then you can launch a BrlAPI application:
$ ~/brltty/Programs/apitest

You may give serveral parameters to the driver:
$ brltty -b xw -t identity -B xtparms="-geometry -0+0",lines=2,cols=20,model=bare
will set a 20x2 braille display appear in the upper right corner of the
display, without any navigation key.
