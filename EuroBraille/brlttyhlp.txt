Some functions are bound to the braille keyboard:
Typing text on the braille keyboard will make the letter passed to the
kernel, as if someone typed the letter on the keyboard.
Note that the braille table implemented is the French Braille Table (CBIFS).
I'll add other tables in the next versions of the driver.
